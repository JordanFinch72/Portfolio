## Why No Stack?!

First off, you must be wondering - "Why on Earth isn't he using React, or Angular, or Rails, or **anything**?!"

After considering my needs, sketching some wireframes, and giving the implementation of the designs some thought, I determined that I wouldn't need to use any frameworks (such as Bootstrap/Tailwind) or stacks (MERN/RoR) to build this.

I, personally, think it's beneficial to always choose the right tool for the job. In this instance, pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript is sufficient for the task at hand, with some small amounts of PHP for e.g. rendering the header on each page.
